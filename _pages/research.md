Hi everyone!

I am an **evolutionary biologist** interested in understanding how species’ current characteristics have been shaped by their evolutionary history. With that in mind, my research is based on the inference of phylogenetic relationships between species using genomic data (**phylogenomics**) and on the comparison and study of the evolution of these species’ genomes according to their phenotype(s) (**comparative genomics**).

Insects are among the most diverse organisms on earth and this mega diversity is often attributed to their close relationship with plants. Indeed, insects and plants interact with each other in many different ways, sometimes with **positive impacts** (e.g. pollination) and other times with serious **negative impacts** (e.g. herbivory).  However, both positive and negative interactions have likely **shaped** the evolution of both groups. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the overall understanding of how insects and plants have evolved together over time, and what the consequences of these interactions have been in their respective evolutionary trajectories.

My work encompasses three main fields:
-	Insect systematics and phylogeny
-	Insect-plant interaction evolution
-	Genomic adaptation signatures in insects
